        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Backy S. Ofo-ob, and I am 20 years old, currently living in the cool and scenic city of Baguio. I am a student at the University of Baguio, majoring in Information Technology. The fast-paced world of tech has always intrigued me, and I am passionate about learning the ins and outs of how technology shapes our everyday lives. My goal is to apply the skills I am learning to make a meaningful impact in the future.</p>

        <p>When I’m not busy with my studies, I like to unwind by indulging in two of my favorite things: coffee and my cellphone. I’m a true coffee lover, and there’s nothing better than sipping on a warm cup while taking a break or brainstorming ideas. As for my free time, I often spend it using my cellphone, whether browsing social media, chatting with friends, or catching up on the latest tech trends. I enjoy staying connected and informed, especially about the latest in the tech world.</p>

        <p>Living in Baguio City has its perks, with the cool weather and stunning views being just some of the many advantages. It’s a great place to balance the demands of college life with some relaxation. Whenever I get the chance, I love walking around the parks or enjoying the famous Baguio strawberries. The city also has a rich cultural history, which makes every day here feel unique. Baguio is the perfect place to grow, both personally and academically.</p>
